# Financial Data Scraping and Database Creation

This Python script scrapes financial data from a website, stores it in a CSV file, and creates a PostgreSQL database to store the data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Selenium WebDriver
- Chrome WebDriver
- pandas
- psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL)
- ChromeDriverManager (for managing Chrome WebDriver)

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install selenium pandas psycopg2 webdriver_manager
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.

2. Run the script by executing `python financial_data_scraper.py`.

3. The script will perform the following tasks:

    - Scrapes financial data from the CNN Markets website for a list of stock symbols.
    - Retrieves the open price, volume, and P/E ratio from Yahoo Finance for each symbol.
    - Stores the data in a CSV file named `project1.csv`.
    - Creates a PostgreSQL database named `project1` and a table named `one` to store the data.

## Configuration

Make sure to update the following configurations in the script according to your needs:

- PostgreSQL database connection settings (host, dbname, user, password).
- The list of stock symbols you want to scrape.

```python
# Update the database connection settings
conn = psycopg2.connect("host=localhost dbname=postgres user=postgres password=password")

# Update the list of stock symbols
mylist = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", ...]
```

## Important Notes

- The script uses web scraping techniques, which may break if the structure of the target websites changes. Please review and update the XPaths used in the script if necessary.

- Be aware of web scraping etiquette and the terms of use of the websites you are scraping data from. Ensure that your scraping activities are allowed and do not violate any terms or conditions.
